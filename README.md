# adr\_gen\_wb.py - register access for hierarchical Wishbone connected systems #
The [wbgen2](https://www.ohwr.org/projects/wishbone-gen/wiki/wbgen2-documentation) is a very nice tool. However, it has certain limitations that were critical for me. Namely it does not support arrays of registers, and does not support nested blocks. Probably it can be extended to support those features, but I definitely prefere to write code generators in Python than in Lua. Therefore I decided to try to write adr\_gen\_wb.py in Python, almost from scratch.

The code is licensed under GPL v2 license.

Please note, that the code is under initial development, and is not usable yet.
